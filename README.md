# Final Project

## Guidelines

Here is your final project repository. As the **project owner** please follow these steps carefully and make sure you understand what you are doing.
- Change the name of the repository with the name of your project: *Settings>Options>Repository Name>Rename*
- Add your teammates as collaborators *Settings>Collaborators & Team>Collaborators>Add Collaborator*
- In your console, create your Rails application with lewagon's devise template: https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/#devise
- Once inside your Rails application folder, remove the existing remote `origin`:
```bash
git remote remove origin
```
- Copy the ssh url of this repo then add a new remote `origin` between your computer and this repo:
```bash
git remote add origin PASTE_THE_SSH_URL
```
- Pull the master branch on your machine:
```
git pull origin master
```
- Push your rails app on GitHub;
```
git push origin master
```

Congrats you're ready for project weeks!!
